The northern door will lead you to a massive chasm be0 0 3 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#yond which lies a yellow door (and an inaccessible Energy Tank), so for now we'll head 0 0 4 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#back towards the Meeting Grounds. We ultimately need to get to the bottom of the Great 0 0 5 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#Temple in the center of the map where the three elevator shafts rise up to the structur0 0 6 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#e.

Once back at the Meeting Grounds, you'll find that half-pipe you passed through e0 0 7 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#arlier is still there, so time to make use of it. If you instead go around the corner a0 0 8 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#nd blow off the green blast shield on the door down the narrow tunnel you'll find the S0 0 9 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#ervice Access area. But if you follow this path you'll eventually reach the Path of Hon0 0 10 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#or room adjacent to where you need to go, but that tricky purple door is blocking your 0 0 11 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#path.

So instead we need to bypass it. Boost yourself up the half-pipe in the Meetin0 0 12 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#g Grounds and scan the Luminoth Lore Projector you find there. Roll through the narrow 0 0 13 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#opening in the small cave nearby and follow the tunnel. Inside you'll find yourself hig0 0 14 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#her up in the Service Access tunnel. Boost your way across the breakable sections of th0 0 15 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#e tunnel, if you fall just head back to the Meeting Grounds and try again. Once through0 0 16 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#, simply follow the tunnel and it'll lead you straight over the purple door and into th0 0 17 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#e Hall of Honored Dead.

What lies ahead is an invasion of the senses. Right above yo0 0 18 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#u hovers the massive Great Temple, while below in the very center of this gargantuan ch0 0 19 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#amber lies your target. But a cage currently houses the item, so you'll need to find a 0 0 20 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#way to open it. Scanning the chamber reveals that four rotatable locks below it are res0 0 21 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#ponsible for the lockdown. Look around you at the four massive Luminoth statues overloo0 0 22 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#king the chamber, at the foot of each one is a coloured Spinner.

Scan the statues to0 0 23 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202# learn more about them, and the order that each Luminoth Sentinel they represent.

Use the Spinners around the chamber to rotate the ground locks.
Now see what happen0 0 27 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#s when you use a Spinner. Each one controls one or two of the rotating circular locks a0 0 28 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#round the containment chamber. You need to spin them all until they lock into place and0 0 29 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202# glow a gold colour. Experiment with the order until you lock them all in place (it isn0 0 30 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#'t particularly hard). Once all locks glow, a large circular lens assembly will rise fr0 0 31 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#om the ground, focusing light onto the containment unit and shattering it.

This awesome new concussive0 0 33 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202# weapon can fire up to five missiles at once at either single or separate targets. You'0 0 34 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#ll also be given a bonus Missile Expansion with this (effectively allowing you up to 250 0 35 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#5 missiles in this game). Let's put it to use straight away. Head down towards the purp0 0 36 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#le door and stand back from it. You should clearly see five small purple pods surroundi0 0 37 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#ng the door. Fire a missile and hold Y to engage the Seeker's reticule.

Wave the ret0 0 38 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#icule over each pod to lock on, then release Y once all five are targeted.

With the door opened step through and make your way through 0 0 41 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#the Service Access. We can now return to Torvus and explore further, but before returni0 0 42 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#ng to the Meeting Grounds pay your ship a visit and save your game there.

Return to 0 0 43 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#Torvus and firstly proceed to the Forgotten Bridge. Before we descend into the bowels o0 0 44 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#f the Bog, we'll take one last trip to Dark Aether. Use the nearby portal to head to th0 0 45 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#e Dark Forgotten Bridge area. As a side note, you can put off visiting this part of Dar0 0 46 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#k Torvus Bog until you've picked up the second Dark Temple Key down in the depths of th0 0 47 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#e region, but we'll go now anyway to pick up a few handy items.

Once there, jump acr0 0 48 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#oss to the bridge and head over to the green door (watch out for Dark Preed floating ab0 0 49 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#out). Blow off the green blast shield with a Super Missile and head inside. Within the 0 0 50 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#next dark tunnel you'll discover a small pool of murky water where a platform with a cr0 0 51 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#ystal embedded atop resides. Scan it for your Logbook, this Liftvine Crystal will rise 0 0 52 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#skyward when energized by the Light Beam.

A lone Hunter Ing will appear to ch0 0 60 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#allenge you, simple energize the Light Beacon near the white door and fight the creatur0 0 61 1369fa9e0b933431ba9debea60cf9834a3617202#e off with the Light Beam.
